# The combination-list will be a list of list of teams - where each list of team will have 1, 2 or 3 teams.
# After getting all possible combinations of students still not assigned, we append that list of team to the successor popped.

# Example: from list of students say - [A, B, C, D, E] and [[A,B,C]] is the successor popped,
# sucessor function will generate successors (list of teams) such as -
# [[ABC],[C]] , [[ABC],[D]], ........[[ABC],[C,D]]..........[[ABC],[C,D,E]]

# for any list of teams it takes into consideration 4 cases:
#       - It will take 5 minutes to grade each assignment, so total grading time is 5 times the number of teams.
#       - Each student who requested a specific group size and was assigned to a different group size will send
#         a complaint email to an instructor, and it will take the instructor 2 minutes to read this email.
#       - If a student is not assigned to someone they requested, there is a 5% probability that the two students
#         will still share code, and if this happens it will take 60 minutes for the instructor to walk through the
#         Academic Integrity. So the time will be 0.05 * 60 = 3 mins
#       - Each student who is assigned to someone they requested not to work with (in question 3 above)
#         complains to the Dean, who meets with the instructor for 10 minutes

    5. To handle the fact that some problems may take longer than others, and you don't know ahead of time how
       much time it will take to find the best solution, you can compute a series of solutions and then
       call "yield" to return that preliminary solution. Your program can continue yielding multiple times;

# Currently, we have implemented DFS algorithm to get a quick solution. Once we get first solution we yeild that and algorithm continues.
# Afterwards, if we get a new solution we check whether the new solution takes less time that previous solution or not. If yes, we yeild that solution otherwise continue.
# In this way, each subsequent solution will have lesser grading time than previous solution. Thus, in each iteration, we get a more optimal solution than previous one.

# ======================================= IMPORTANT POINT ========================================================
# Note: while executing pytest, for test2.txt sometimes the algorithm takes more time than predefined threshold. Thus, is may not pass the test2 for one particular execution.
# Since we have implemented DFS, sometimes the first successor popped has time - 80 or even 101 and may take long time to reach the lowest possible value (43) within the 
# specified time. However, if time is not constratint , the algorithm will ALWAYS reach lowest time- 43.

# I have also included output screenshots for proof.
