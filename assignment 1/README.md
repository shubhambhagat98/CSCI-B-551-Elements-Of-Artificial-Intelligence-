# Part 1:  2021  Puzzle

### State Abstraction:

### Set of valid states:  
All possible valid states that reach to a goal.

### Successor function: 
Successor function calculates all possible(24) valid row, column and ring transformations for a particular state.

### Cost function: 
Cost function is the sum of the actual path of moving from one state to another which is unit distance =1 and the admissible heuristic used which is the Modified Manhattan Distance in this case. 
Hence, In this case, cost function can be defined as f(s) = g(s) + h(s), where, h(s) is the admissible Heuristic  which is the cost of reaching goal state from current state and g(s) is the cost of reaching current state from initial state.

### Goal state definition: 
Goal state is all the element in the matrix arranged in the proper ascending order.

### Initial state: 
Initial state is the initial house map that’s given in the question.


### Implementation:
	
-	I have implemented A* Search that expands the state with the minimum value of the 
of the cost function(modified Manhattan distance).
-	I have created methods to implement all the 24 possible row, column and ring transformations.
-	The cost function here is basically our Modified Manhattan Distance.
-	In each case we check the values for the x and y coordinates of the manhattan distance.
-	As the game works like a circularly linked list where each row and column is connected circularly to itself, every time when the cost of one of the absoluted coordinates is 4 we, change it to 1.
-	Similarly, when the cost of one of the absoluted coordinates is 3 we, change it to 2. 
-	And only now we add the x and y coordinates to get the correct admissible manhattan distance. 
-	We can get the ideal row and column coordinates of an element.
-	When we floor divide an element with 5 we get the ideal row location for that element.
-	When we modulo divide an element with 5 we get the ideal column location for that element.
-	In the end, as when we perform any row, column or ring transformation, we move atleast 5 elements at a time.
-	So here, we divide the cumulative manhattan distance by 5 before returning.
-	The way we create the Heuristic function here is very important to get the optimal answers in the least number of moves. Tweaking the Manhattan distance heuristic works well for this puzzle for the Board 0 and Board 0.5.
-	Board 1 takes time to generate an answer.

### Q1. In this problem, what is the branching factor of the search tree?

In this case, as in total for one state, there are 24 possible valid row, column and ring transformations. Hence the branching factor is 24.

### Q2. If  the  solution  can  be  reached  in  7  moves,  about  how  many  states  would  we  need        to  explore  before  we found it if we used BFS instead of A* search?  A rough answer is fine.

For BFS, in the best case, at each level out of the 7 it would expand all the 24 nodes at each level. Hence we would need to explore approximately 24^7 nodes before we reach the goal in BFS.

# Part 2: Road Trip
## Assigned member: Henish Shah

### State Space:
The state space for this problem statement is the exhaustive set of all possible routes from point ‘A’ to point ‘B’ essentially covering all the cities in the map.

### Successor Function:
The successor function for any point returns the set of cities/nodes directly connected to it.

### Edge Weights:
Based on the given input of the cost function i.e. ‘time’, ’segments’, ’distance’ or ‘delivery’ we minimise the respective parameters for our desired route.

### Goal State:
The goal state is nothing but the final end node/ final destination of our route.

### Heuristic Function:
The heuristic function for this problem statement is *Haversine distance*. This is an admissible heuristic function due to the fact that it takes into consideration the longitude and the latitude of the cities. Thus, the distance is essentially a straight line drawn along the surface of the earth between two cities which will always be less than the actual distance of the route between them (the heuristic function never overestimates)

### Search Algorithm:
The search algorithm used for this problem statement is A* search. This technique always returns the optimal solution. As we use a priority queue based on a weighted combination of the heuristic function and the cost function *{a\*h(s) + g(s)}*
 
### Exceptional Cases:
There were some cities for which there were no co-ordinates. The initial approach we took was trying to find the missing co-ordinates (Point C) such that for two of its successor nodes whose co-ordinates are given (Point A, Point B), the three points form a triangle. Forming a triangle, given the sides AB, BC, AC we tried to find the co-ordinate of point C. The reason that it did not work was because we have longitude and latitude instead of cartesian co-ordinates (If given more time and by doing a few adjustments, I’m sure that this approach should work for the longitudes and latitudes as well).

Although, we then considered returning the heuristic value as 0 for cases where the co-ordinates are missing. This substitute also works seamlessly for such cases.

# Part 3: Assign Teams
## Assigned member: Shubham Narendra Bhagat

### Set of valid states:
All possible list of teams, where each team is formed from all possible combination for a given list of students.

### Initial state:
List of teams which is empty. i.e.: No teams formed yet.

### Successor function: 
The successor take input as list of teams and list of pending students. It will create combinations from list of pending students. The combination-list will be a list of lists of teams - where each list of teams will have 1, 2 or 3 teams. After getting all possible combinations of students still not assigned, we append that list of teams to the successor popped.

Example: from list of students say - [A, B, C, D, E] and [[A, B, C]] is the successor popped,
Successor function will generate successors (list of teams) such as -
[[ABC], [C]], [[ABC], [D]], ........[[ABC], [C, D]] ..........[[ABC], [C, D, E]]

### Cost function: 
This function will calculate the total time it will take to grade each successor
For any list of teams, it takes into consideration 4 cases:
-	It will take 5 minutes to grade each assignment, so total grading time is 5 times the number of teams.
-	Each student who requested a specific group size and was assigned to a different group size will send
-	a complaint email to an instructor, and it will take the instructor 2 minutes to read this email.
-	If a student is not assigned to someone they requested, there is a 5% probability that the two students will still share code, and if this happens it will take 60 minutes for the instructor to walk through the Academic Integrity. So, the time will be 0.05 * 60 = 3 mins
-	Each student who is assigned to someone they requested not to work with, complains to the Dean, who meets with the instructor for 10 minutes
The total cost will be cumulative of time is takes for all above cases.

### Goal state: 
A list of teams which contains all the students.

## Approach:

-	Currently, we have implemented DFS algorithm to get a quick solution. Once we get first solution, we yield that, and algorithm continues to find another solution.
-	Afterwards, if we get a new solution, we check whether the new solution takes less time that previous solution or not. If yes, we yield that solution otherwise continue.
-	In this way, each subsequent solution will have lesser grading time than previous solution. 
-	Thus, in each iteration, we get a more optimal solution than previous one.

### Pseudocode:
```
min_time = 1000
fringe = [ [(),0] ] #Empty list of teams
while fringe:
	current  fringe.pop ()
	successor _list  successor (current, pending_student_list)
	for each succ in successor_list:
		calculate total time
		if succ == goal and total_time < min_time
			yeild solution
			min_time = total_time
		else:
			fringe.append(succ)
```
### IMPORTANT NOTE:

While executing pytest, for test2.txt sometimes the algorithm takes more time than predefined threshold. Thus, it may not pass the test2 for one execution but not for every instance of execution.
Since we have implemented DFS, sometimes the first successor popped has time 80 or even 101 and may take long time to reach the lowest possible value (43) within the 
specified time. However, if time is not constraint, the algorithm will ALWAYS reach lowest time- 43.

### Pytest on Silo

As I mentioned above for one instance of pytest, the test failed but on subsequent instance of pytest, the test passed. This ambiguity happens due to unpredictable nature (incompleteness) of DFS
